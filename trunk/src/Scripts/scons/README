How to setup scons:

1. Install scons.
2. Run setup_scons.py to make a symlink to this SConstruct.
3. Copy SConstruct.options into the toplevel physbam directory and adjust if desired.
4. Here's my alias to run scons:'scons -u -j 32'
   '-u' tells scons to look up the file tree to find an SConstruct.
   '-j 32' sets scons to build multiple (32) targets in parallel.
